# 🎵 MP3 Player (Doubly Linked List)

An educational MP3 player built using a **doubly linked list** to demonstrate core data structure concepts such as traversal, previous/next navigation, and node-based playlists.

---

## 📚 About the Project

This project is designed for **learning purposes** and showcases how a **doubly linked list** can be used to manage and navigate through MP3 files efficiently.

It is intended as a data structures demonstration rather than a production-level media player.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure (Required)

On first use, you must select a **main MP3 files folder**.

Inside this main folder, **each MP3 file must be placed inside its own separate subfolder**.

### Example Folder Layout
```
MP3_Files/
├── Song1/
│ └── song1.mp3
├── Song2/
│ └── song2.mp3
├── Song3/
│ └── song3.mp3
```

### Rules
- ✅ One MP3 file per folder  
- ✅ Each MP3 file must be inside a subfolder  
- ❌ Do not place MP3 files directly in the main folder  
- ❌ Do not place multiple MP3 files in a single folder  

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Launch the MP3 Player
2. On first run, select the **main MP3 files folder**
3. The application scans all subfolders
4. Each MP3 file is loaded into a doubly linked list
5. Use **Next / Previous** navigation to traverse the playlist

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

- **Doubly Linked List**
  - Each node represents one MP3 file
  - Supports forward and backward traversal
  - Enables efficient playlist navigation

---

## ℹ️ Notes

- Only subfolders are scanned
- Folder names may represent song names or identifiers
- Only `.mp3` files are supported
- This project is intended strictly for **educational use**
